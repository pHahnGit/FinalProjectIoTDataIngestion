# FinalProjectIoTDataIngestion
A project about ingestion of Sensor Agnostic Data and transformation of such in an IoT domain.

This is a final project, after heavy removal of confidential implementation logic and information, from two students of UCN. 
The project, alongside an report, recieved top marks (A / 12) at the final exam of a Computer Science AP degree.
The project is a proof of concept of a generic IoT backend service, that can be expanded upon with domain specific entities as needed.
The project might be expanded in the future and feel free to provide insight, comments or anything that you feel relevant to inform us about.
